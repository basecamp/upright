## v0.3.1

Security backport release for v0.3.0 installs.

### Security

- Fix an authenticated SSRF through the Prometheus/Alertmanager proxies: a
  protocol-relative path (`//host`) could retarget the upstream request at an
  arbitrary host (RFC1918, the Docker network, cloud metadata). Forwarded paths
  are now validated and the resolved host is re-checked, with a `faraday >= 2.14.3`
  floor (CVE-2026-25765).
- Refuse cross-site requests to the metrics proxies on the session-cookie path
  via a Fetch-Metadata / Origin gate; only same-origin, user-initiated, and
  same-site top-level navigations are honoured (CVE-2026-67990).
- Require a POST with a valid authenticity token on the `static_credentials`
  sign-in callback, and fail closed when `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is unset instead of
  shipping a default password (CVE-2026-67993).
- Scope the session cookie to the configured hostname rather than its registrable
  parent, so a sibling domain can't be handed the admin session, and mark it
  httponly (F-08).
